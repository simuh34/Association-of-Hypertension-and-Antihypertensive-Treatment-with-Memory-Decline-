# Association of Hypertension and Antihypertensive Treatment with Memory Function and Decline among Middle-Aged and Older Adults across Four Countries, 2010 to 2019
# Overview
This project leverages data from four longitudinal studies (HRS, ELSA, MHAS, CHARLS) to explore the association between hypertension, its treatment status, and long - term memory decline over 6 - 8 years among adults aged 50+ in the US, England, Mexico, and China. It examines how hypertension (defined by BP levels or antihypertensive use) and antihypertensive treatment impact memory function (assessed via word recall scores, standardized as Z - scores). Results reveal cross - country variations in the link between hypertension, treatment, and memory decline, highlighting the need for tailored public health strategies to mitigate ADRD burden by targeting these modifiable factors.
